## Executive Statement

### Background

Goal of clustering is to identify accounts that are similar and seek potentials for energy efficiency. 
Clustering accounts based on these profiles allows for the comparison and contrasting of those with similar energy usage tendencies.

Traditional methods of utility providers tend to aggregating usage at much higher aggregation levels.  This method does not necessarliy accounts for customer accounts  may be similar to each other in energy usage tendencies on an aggregated level, but not in their hourly usage throughout the day because of environmental and behavioral differences.

Additionally, the prediction of hourly residential electricity consumption is of great economical interest for electricity providers in the global electricity market, since an accurate prediction of the consumption ahead of time is needed to obtain the best prices on the day-ahead market and to avoid purchasing on the more expensive real-time market.


### Problem Statements

1. Clustering by electricity usage profile
    -  Identify patterns in residential customer electricity hourly usage and group customers based on similar usage profiles tendencies.  
    -  Identify customers that deviate in their hourly usage ove and above their peer accounts during peak demand hours where electricity prices are the highest (4pm-6pm on Summer days) 


2. Predict residential electricity hourly usage
    -  Current method to forecast a customerâ€™s residential electricity usage is error-prone and could be more accurate. 
    -  The goal is to predict individual residential electricity hourly usage day ahead better than the current benchmark method.
    -  This will allow retail electricity providers from spending more on the real-day market for errors in day-ahead prediction for their customers.
