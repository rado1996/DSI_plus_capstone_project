    "## Executive Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of clustering is to identify accounts that are similar and seek potentials for energy efficiency. \n",
    "Clustering accounts based on these profiles allows for the comparison and contrasting of those with similar energy usage tendencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional methods of utility providers tend to aggregating usage at much higher aggregation levels.  This method does not necessarliy accounts for customer accounts  may be similar to each other in energy usage tendencies on an aggregated level, but not in their hourly usage throughout the day because of environmental and behavioral differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the prediction of hourly residential electricity consumption is of great economical interest for electricity providers in the global electricity market, since an accurate prediction of the consumption ahead of time is needed to obtain the best prices on the day-ahead market and to avoid purchasing on the more expensive real-time market. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering by electricity usage profile\n",
    "    -  Identify patterns in residential customer electricity hourly usage and group customers based on similar usage profiles tendencies.  \n",
    "    -  Identify customers that deviate in their hourly usage ove and above their peer accounts during peak demand hours where electricity prices are the highest (4pm-6pm on Summer days) \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Predict residential electricity hourly usage\n",
    "    -  Current method to forecast a customer’s residential electricity usage is error-prone and could be more accurate.  \n",
    "    -  The goal is to predict individual residential electricity hourly usage day ahead better than the current benchmark method.\n",
    "    -  This will allow retail electricity providers from spending more on the real-day market for errors in day-ahead prediction for their customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Retrieved from a data repository provided by Pecan Street, an organization focused providing access to data on consumer energy consumption behavior for research purposes.\n",
    "-  Hourly electricity usage for almost 1,000 residential customers across the United States from 2011 through 2017\n",
    "-  Demographic information including housing square footage, annual income, education level, and number of occupants.\n",
    "-  Access to hundreds of residential house/apartment electricity customers from Texas, Colorado, and California.\n",
    "    -  899 customers from Austin, Texas\n",
    "    -  58 customers from Boulder, Colorado\n",

    "\n",
    "1. metadata\n",
    "    -  This view draws data from multiple tables on the Dataport database to provide general information about each data ID in one location. The metadata view shows the useful information about the customers including housing square footage and housing typel, which makes it particularly useful to researchers looking to assemble a dataset containing all the necessary data to answer a research question.\n",
    "2. electricity_egauge_hours\n",
    "    -  This table stores all of the electricity data collected by Pecan Street’s eGauge devices. It is aggregated to hourly intervals, where the specified timestamp is the beginning of the interval for that row. All of the values in this table are average real power over the interval in kilowatts (kW). Timestamps indicate the starting time for the interval over which the data was measured.\n",
    "3. survey_(2011-2014)_all_participants\n",
    "    -  This table stores the results of the 2012 Pecan Street general participant survey. Questions on this survey asked about topics including demographics, electricity use, eductional level and income level of the residents.\n",
